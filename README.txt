Tableau - COVID-19 Dashboard  
                             
Dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
Data pulled on July 6th 2021

This portfolio piece is to demonstrate some of my Tableau skills.
Skills used: Animations, Race Charts, Calculated Fields, Map Analysis, Creating Dashboards
Note: Due to Tableau Public, you cannot see the animations properly. I suggest to download MP4 recording or view directly in the Tableau Workbook.
